Got it — here’s a clean, professional README.md draft for your text summariser app. It explains how it works, the backend/frontend flow, and the Hugging Face model integration:

Text Summariser

Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to summarize text or articles from a URL. It provides two modes of summarization:
	•	Extractive (fast): Selects the most important sentences from the text.
	•	Abstractive (LLM): Uses a Hugging Face transformer model to rewrite and condense the text into a human-like summary.

The application also provides additional insights such as keywords, sentiment analysis, word count, and estimated reading time.

How It Works

1. Frontend (React)
	•	The frontend (App.js) provides a simple interface where users can:
	•	Paste text directly.
	•	Enter a URL to fetch article content.
	•	Choose between extractive or abstractive summarization.
	•	Select summary length (short, medium, long).
	•	The frontend sends a POST request to the backend API with the following payload:

{
  "text": "Sample input text...",
  "mode": "abstractive",
  "length": "medium"
}

or

{
  "url": "https://example.com/article",
  "mode": "extractive",
  "length": "short"
}

	•	Results (summary, keywords, sentiment, etc.) are displayed in a styled UI.

2. Backend (FastAPI)
	•	The backend is built with FastAPI and exposes two main endpoints:
	•	/analyze-text for direct text input.
	•	/analyze-url for fetching and analyzing article content from a URL.
	•	Depending on the mode:
	•	Extractive: Uses rake-nltk and traditional NLP techniques to pick out key sentences.
	•	Abstractive: Calls a Hugging Face transformer model (facebook/bart-large-cnn) via the transformers pipeline to generate a rewritten summary.
	•	Additional features:
	•	Keyword extraction: via RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction).
	•	Sentiment analysis: basic polarity scoring.
	•	Word count and reading time: calculated from input text.

3. Model Integration (Hugging Face Transformers)
	•	The abstractive mode uses the facebook/bart-large-cnn model from Hugging Face.
	•	This model is pre-trained for text summarization and fine-tuned on large datasets.
	•	The backend integrates with Hugging Face via the transformers library:

from transformers import pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
summary = summarizer(text, max_length=150, min_length=50, do_sample=False)

	•	Summaries are generated based on the selected length parameter, which adjusts the min_length and max_length.

Tech Stack

Frontend:
	•	React (JavaScript)
	•	CSS for styling

Backend:
	•	FastAPI (Python)
	•	Uvicorn (server)
	•	Hugging Face Transformers
	•	Torch
	•	Newspaper3k (for article scraping)
	•	NLTK + RAKE-NLTK (keywords)
	•	BeautifulSoup4 + Requests (URL parsing)

⸻

Running the Application

Prerequisites
	•	Node.js (for frontend)
	•	Python 3.9+ (for backend)

Install Backend Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Backend

uvicorn main:app --reload

Install Frontend Dependencies

cd frontend
npm install

Run Frontend

npm start

The app should be available at http://localhost:3000 and will communicate with the backend running on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Summary

This project combines traditional extractive methods with modern transformer-based abstractive summarization to provide flexible, high-quality summaries. It demonstrates how to link a React frontend with a FastAPI backend and integrate Hugging Face models for natural language processing tasks.

Do you want me to also include a diagram showing the data flow (Frontend → Backend → Hugging Face Model → Response → Frontend)? That could make the README more visual and easy to follow.
